This github page contains the source code (as well as some descriptions) for the "mrdd" package. This package implements the two-dimensional RD estimation described in Cheng (2020). The two main functions are mrdd.fn (which estimates the two-dimensional RD), and create_plot (which generates plots based on the estimates).
