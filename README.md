This github page contains the source code (as well as some descriptions) for the "mrdd" package. This package implements the two-dimensional RD estimation described in Cheng (2020). The two main functions are mrdd.fn (which estimates the two-dimensional RD), and create_plot (which generates plots based on the estimates).
The "mrdd" R package can be installed in R if the user has the "devtools" package installed, by running the command:
```
devtools::install_github("alden1505/rd_multiple_running_var_code")
```
